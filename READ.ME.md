# Project 4 for ART 3020  
# Interactive Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is my interactive portfolio website for Project 4 in ART 3020. The site showcases my work as a digital artist and creative coder. It includes personal projects, creative coding, a resume, and fun interactive elements that reflect my personality.

## Concept
The goal of this site was to blend a professional presentation with playful interactivity. From generative patterns to animated speech bubbles, the portfolio represents both the technical and creative aspects of my work.

Each page is designed with accessibility, semantic structure, and visual consistency in mind.

## Features
- **Logo Animation**: Logo shakes when hovered over
- **Responsive Navigation**: Hamburger menu on mobile, fixed header on desktop
- **Animated Navigation**: Navigation underlined when hovered over
- **Welcome Page Animation**: Typing text effect and waving hand emoji
- **Project Pages**: Generative art (p5.js), image galleries, and code overlays to   
                     make the images larger
- **About Page**: Interactive image with randomized speech bubble messages
- **Resume Page**: Styled resume with downloadable PDF
- **Contact Form**: Simple accessible contact submission form
- **Back to Top Button**: Smooth scroll and subtle styling
